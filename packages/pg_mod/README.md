# Deuterium Mods

This package contains the sql migrations for Deuterium data protections. It extends a pre-existing postgres database with ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control). It handles multiple frameworks by templating with jinja2 and formats the distributions with sql-formatter.

Check the builds directory for desired migration.
