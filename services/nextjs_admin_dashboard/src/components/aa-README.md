# Components

This is our ui / ux folder. It's composed of slightly customized shadcn-ui components and any custom components. There should not be any sub folders and only 1 exported component per file (with the exception of the base shadcn-ui components). This is meant to keep the mental overhead of creating new functions low and reduce barriers to entry.
